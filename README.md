# Ruoff Music Center Show Calendar Manager

This project helps manage concert schedules for Ruoff Music Center by adding them to a Google Calendar.

## Features

*   `scrape_ruoff_shows.py`: (Potentially deprecated) Scrapes upcoming shows from Live Nation for Ruoff Music Center and adds them to a Google Calendar. It also attempts to detect new or removed shows compared to the last run.
*   `add_manual_shows_to_calendar.py`: Adds a predefined list of shows for a specific year (currently 2024) to Google Calendar. This is useful for historical data or when scraping is unreliable.
*   `google_calendar_service.py`: Handles the interaction with the Google Calendar API.

## Setup

1.  **Google Calendar API Credentials**:
    *   Enable the Google Calendar API in your Google Cloud Console.
    *   Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and download the `credentials.json` file.
    *   Place `credentials.json` in the root directory of this project.
    *   The first time a script needing calendar access runs, it will prompt you to authorize access via a web browser. This will create a `token.json` file for future authentications.
2.  **Python Environment**:
    *   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
3.  **Target Calendar ID**:
    *   Open `google_calendar_service.py`.
    *   Update the `TARGET_CALENDAR_ID` variable with the ID of the Google Calendar you want the shows to be added to.
