# Ruoff Music Center Show Calendar Manager

This project scrapes upcoming shows for Ruoff Music Center from Live Nation, adds them to a Google Calendar, and generates an HTML report. The process is fully automated to run daily via GitHub Actions.

## Features

*   **Daily Scraping**: Automatically scrapes show data from the Live Nation website.
*   **Google Calendar Integration**: Adds new shows to a specified Google Calendar and intelligently skips duplicates.
*   **New/Removed Show Notifications**: Compares the latest scrape against the previous day's list and logs any new or removed shows.
*   **HTML Report**: Generates a clean, print-friendly HTML report (`docs/index.html`) of all current shows, highlighting new ones and noting when they were first added.
*   **Persistent Timestamps**: Tracks when each show was first detected and displays this "Added On" date in the report.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules for clarity and maintainability:

*   `run.py`: The main executable script that orchestrates the entire process.
*   `scraper.py`: Handles all web scraping logic using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
*   `date_parser.py`: Manages complex date and time string parsing.
*   `data_manager.py`: Handles reading from and writing to local data files (`.csv`, `.txt`, `.json`).
*   `html_generator.py`: Contains the logic for creating the HTML report.
*   `google_calendar_service.py`: Manages all interactions with the Google Calendar API.

## Setup

1.  **Google Cloud Project**:
    *   Enable the Google Calendar API in your Google Cloud Console.
    *   Create a **Service Account** and download its JSON key file.
    *   Rename the key file to `credentials.json` and place it in the root directory.
    *   Share your target Google Calendar with the service account's email address (found in `credentials.json`), giving it permission to "Make changes to events".

2.  **GitHub Repository Secrets**:
    *   `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`: The entire content of your `credentials.json` file.
    *   `GOOGLE_TOKEN_JSON`: This is for the deprecated OAuth flow and is no longer needed with a Service Account. You can remove this secret.
    *   `GH_PAT`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope, used by the workflow to push updated data files back to the repository.

3.  **Python Environment**:
    *   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **Target Calendar ID**:
    *   Open `google_calendar_service.py`.
    *   Update the `TARGET_CALENDAR_ID` variable with your Google Calendar's ID.

## Usage

*   **Automated**: The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs automatically every day.
*   **Manual**: To run the script locally, use the batch file:
    ```powershell
    .\run_scraper.bat
    ```
